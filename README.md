# B & J Biscuit Dashboard – Project Overview
## Project Goals
The primary goal of the B & J Biscuit Dashboard was to provide a data-driven decision-making tool that enables the company to track and analyze its financial performance, sales trends, and key business contributors. The dashboard was designed to:

- **Visualize revenue trends** across different time periods (quarterly, monthly, weekly).
- **Identify top-performing products, locations, customers, and sales personnel.**
- **Evaluate profitability and cost structures** to improve margins.
- **Enhance strategic decision-making** by offering clear, actionable insights.

## Business Needs
B & J Biscuit needed a centralized reporting system that:
- **Provides a holistic view of business performance** at a glance.
- **Breaks down revenue streams by product category, location, age group, and payment method.**
- **Highlights key profitability drivers,** such as top-selling brands and customers.
- **Tracks revenue fluctuations** over different periods to identify trends and seasonality effects.
- **Offers dynamic filtering options** to allow for deeper data exploration.

## Discovering and Presenting Insights
To extract meaningful insights, a structured approach was followed:

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Raw sales and  financial data were processed to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Key metrics were analyzed to uncover revenue patterns, high-performing categories, and customer behaviors.
3. **Data Visualization** – Intuitive and interactive **charts, tables, and KPIs** were implemented to highlight trends, outliers, and key drivers.
4. **Filter & Drill-Down Options** – Users can refine data by location, payment method, and age group for a **customized analysis experience.**
5. **Performance Comparisons** – The dashboard includes **Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ), Month-over-Month (MoM), and Week-over-Week (WoW) performance tracking** for trend analysis.

## Key Takeaways
- Shortbread is the most profitable brand, with Chicago as a key revenue-driving location.
- Robert Hernandez is the top customer, while Travis Doyle leads in sales performance.
- Revenue is highest in Q1 and Q2, with peak months being January, July, and March.
- The profit margin stands at 44%, with revenue largely generated from premium-priced products.
- San Antonio, San Jose, and Philadelphia are top revenue-generating locations.
- Cash, credit, debit, and mobile payments contribute almost equally to revenue distribution.


This dashboard serves as a powerful strategic tool that helps B & J Biscuit optimize pricing strategies, allocate resources efficiently, and improve customer targeting for sustained growth.
